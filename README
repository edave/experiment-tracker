Humans & Automation Lab Experiment Scheduler
=====================================================

Written for Rails 3.0 and Ruby 1.8.7
Tested using MySQL, but should work with all SQL servers

Install Notes:

* Copy config/database.yml.sample to config/database.yml and change to match your database configuration
* Config your mailer settings in config/application.rb
* Change the secret token in config/initializers/secret_token.rb
* Change the encrypted attribute secret key in config/application.rb
* Change the timezone to match your location in config/application.rb

Known Issues:

* Changing user attributes is broken
* Caching does not work properly
* Issues with CSRF
* Layout issues once a user is signed in

Running:

Setup as a standard Rails application with your webserver.

Start the Rooster plugin to process emails to participants/experimenters and to put appointments in Google Calendar. Starting the Rooster plugin must be done every time your server is updated/restarted:
rake rooster:launch # launch Rooster
rake rooster:exit # shutdown Rooster

Create an initial user and use this account to create a Group, Location and (optionally) a Google Calendar account. All actual users need a Group to belong to, and all experiments need a Location.
