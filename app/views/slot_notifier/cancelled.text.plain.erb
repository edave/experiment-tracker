We're sorry, we had to cancel your experiment.

Repairs to the helicopter have taken longer than anticipated and we are cancelling experiments this week.

If you are still interested in participating, please email David Pitman at dpitman@mit.edu to be notified when we will run our next round of experiments (likely over IAP).

Thanks for your understanding!
